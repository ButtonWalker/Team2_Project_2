# Team 2 Project 2

# Introduction
While the decision to relocate and concur a new city is exciting, it can also be a daunting prospect with so many factors to consider when determining where to live.  The timing of this project is spot on as one of our team members is in the process of finding a new city to relocate and call home. As a team we decided to offer our help by developing a location-based analytics app that will help alleviate the burden by allowing the user to eliminate the guesswork and make data driven decisions based on customizable criteria that visualized the results in an interactive dashboard.
In parallel, we will be telling a tale of three very different cities.  Our goal is to provide meaningful insights and highlight the underlying data which contributes to what is expected to be a stark contrast between the selected cities of San Francisco, Dallas, and Jackson. 

### Purpose of the Analysis

The objective of Project 2 is to use the selected data for the three selected cities (Dallas, Jackson and San Francisco) to tell a story through data visualizations of the usersâ€™ interaction exploring the data themselves. Our purpose is to allow the user to select a city of interest (move to city) and choose from a list of given criteria that will return the results in a graphical visualization of the comparative underlying data. Through this interactive experience the user will be able to make a decision on the best city to relocate based on their chosen criteria.
